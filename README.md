# Android Simple Boilerplate
Provides a convenient **basic start-off point** for all your new Android projects.

Tries to employ the best tools and practices.  
**Does not** contain (almost) any architectural patterns or solutions.

It draws inspiration from Chris Banes's [Tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi) but adds many customizations and optimizations.

>***Note:*** this project is Kotlin-based and is not designed to be Java-friendly.

### Things included
- **Gradle setup** with all its little quirks
- buildSrc module with Gradle Kotlin DSL. It provides autocomplete and other niceties in managing Gradle dependencies
- **CI/CD** with automated Unit/Robolectric tests, Firebase Test Lab integration, and Play Store publishing
- **Static code analysis**
- **Crash reporting** via Crashlytics
- Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Simple Dagger2 setup
